# KNN
### 1.Apple vs Orange) You are given a K-NN code for Apple vs Orange prob- lem. Please read and understand the code. Now perform the following tasks: (a) Synthetically increase the dataset size to 50 samples, (b) Edit the code so that random 80%, 10%, and 10% samples are used for training, testing, and validation respectively. (c) Change the value of K to 3, 5, and 7 and compare the validation set and test set results. (d) Write a code that draws confusion matrices for different K. Use the following link to understand about Confusion Matrix.


This is one of my first and simplest ML model that have been implemented during my course work.
